# HD1 Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

**HD1 v5.0.0 - Architectural Decision Documentation**

This section contains all architectural decision records (ADRs) that document the design decisions made throughout HD1's development. These decisions provide transparency into the technical choices and evolution of the system.

## ðŸ“‹ **ADR Overview**

Architectural Decision Records capture important architectural decisions made during development, including the context, the decision, and the consequences. Each ADR represents a significant choice that affects the system's structure, behavior, or development process.

### **ADR Process**
All significant architectural decisions are documented using the ADR format:
1. **Context** - The situation that motivates the decision
2. **Decision** - The architectural decision made
3. **Status** - Accepted, Superseded, or Rejected
4. **Consequences** - Expected outcomes and trade-offs

## ðŸ“š **Complete ADR Collection**

For the complete collection of all 23 ADRs with detailed timeline and cross-references, see:

## ðŸ”„ **Decision Status Overview**

### **Active Decisions** (Currently Implemented)
- **22 Accepted ADRs** - Currently guiding system design
- **1 Superseded ADR** - ADR-014 (replaced by channel architecture)

### **Decision Evolution**
The ADR collection shows HD1's evolution through distinct phases:
1. **Foundation** (v1.0-v2.x) - Basic platform establishment
2. **Integration** (v3.0-v3.6) - A-Frame and auto-generation
3. **Organization** (v4.0.0) - Code structure and templates
4. **Revolution** (v5.0.0) - API-first game engine transformation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Using ADRs for Development**

### **For New Team Members**
ADRs provide essential context for understanding why the system is designed as it is. Reading the ADR collection helps developers understand:
- Historical context for design decisions
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Implementation patterns and standards

### **For Future Decisions**
When making new architectural decisions:
1. Review existing ADRs for precedent and consistency
2. Consider impact on existing decisions
3. Document new decisions following the established format
4. Update related ADRs if decisions are superseded

### **For System Evolution**
ADRs guide system evolution by:
- Providing clear migration paths when decisions change
- Documenting rationale for avoiding certain approaches
- Establishing patterns for consistent decision-making
