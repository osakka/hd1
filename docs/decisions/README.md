# HD1 Architectural Decisions

This directory contains the complete architectural decision framework for HD1, documenting the evolution from concept to production-ready API-first game engine platform.

## Purpose

HD1's decision framework ensures:
- **Traceability**: Every architectural choice is documented with context and rationale
- **Consistency**: All decisions align with core principles and strategic direction
- **Reversibility**: Future decisions can reference and potentially supersede previous ones
- **Surgical Precision**: Changes are made with complete understanding of dependencies and impacts

## Decision Process

HD1 follows a structured decision-making process:

1. **Problem Identification**: Technical challenge or opportunity requiring architectural choice
2. **Context Analysis**: Current state, constraints, requirements, and stakeholder needs
3. **Options Evaluation**: Multiple approaches considered with trade-off analysis
4. **Decision Documentation**: Chosen approach with rationale in ADR format
5. **Implementation Validation**: Decision outcomes tracked and verified
6. **Impact Assessment**: Long-term consequences monitored and documented

## Core Architectural Principles

All decisions are evaluated against HD1's fundamental principles:

### Single Source of Truth
- **api.yaml specification** drives all code generation
- **ADRs** serve as definitive architectural record
- **No parallel implementations** or duplicate functionality
- **Surgical precision** in maintaining consistency

### API-First Architecture  
- **Everything via REST endpoints** - complete functionality exposure
- **WebSocket for real-time sync** - state change broadcasting only
- **Specification-driven development** - automatic client generation
- **Zero manual synchronization** between API and clients

### Zero Regressions Policy
- **Backward compatibility** maintained across all changes
- **Build validation** prevents incomplete implementations
- **Comprehensive testing** before architectural changes
- **Rollback capabilities** for all major decisions

### Production Quality Standards
- **Enterprise-grade** security and performance requirements
- **Thread-safe** implementations with proper concurrency control
- **Professional standards** in all user-facing interfaces
- **Comprehensive logging** and monitoring capabilities

## Strategic Direction

HD1's architectural decisions support the strategic goal of becoming the world's first **API-First Game Engine Platform**:

- **Game Engine Capabilities**: Complete 3D engine functionality via REST APIs
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multi-user environments with <10ms synchronization
- **Developer Experience**: Auto-generated clients for all programming environments
- **Market Differentiation**: Unique "Game Engine as a Service" positioning

## Decision Authority

Architectural decisions follow HD1's governance model:
- **Technical Direction**: Guided by API-first and zero-regression principles
- **Implementation Standards**: Surgical precision with comprehensive validation
- **Quality Requirements**: Production-ready standards for all components
- **Evolution Path**: Systematic enhancement without breaking existing functionality

## Documentation Standards

All architectural decisions must include:
- **Context**: Problem statement and environmental factors
- **Decision**: Specific architectural choice with technical details
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was selected over alternatives
- **Consequences**: Expected positive, negative, and neutral impacts
- **Implementation**: Verification of successful deployment
- **Cross-References**: Dependencies and relationships to other decisions
