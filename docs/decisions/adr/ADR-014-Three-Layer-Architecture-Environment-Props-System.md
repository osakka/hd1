# ADR-014: Three-Layer Architecture - Environment + Props System

## Status
**SUPERSEDED** - Replaced by Channel Architecture in v5.0.0 (see ADR-022)
**Original implementation**: 2025-06-30 to 2025-07-03

## Context
Following game engine architecture patterns (Unity, Unreal), HD1 required a scalable three-layer system to manage complex 3D scenes with realistic physics. The original single-layer approach couldn't handle environment-specific physics or reusable props efficiently.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive three-layer architecture:

### Layer 1: Environments
- **Purpose**: Define physics context (gravity, atmosphere, scale)
- **API**: `/environments` (GET/POST)
- **Storage**: `/opt/hd1/share/environments/`
- **Physics Parameters**: gravity, scale_unit, atmosphere, density, temperature

### Layer 2: Props
- **Purpose**: Reusable objects with physics properties
- **API**: `/props` (GET), `/sessions/{sessionId}/props/{propId}` (POST)
- **Storage**: `/opt/hd1/share/props/` (YAML definitions)
- **Physics Properties**: mass, friction, restitution, density, materials

### Layer 3: Scenes (Future Phase 3)
- **Purpose**: Orchestration of environments + props
- **Integration**: Scene scripts reference environment + prop combinations

## Implementation Details

### Environment System
```yaml
# Example: molecular-scale.sh
ENVIRONMENT_ID="molecular-scale"
ENVIRONMENT_NAME="Molecular Scale" 
SCALE_UNIT="nm"
GRAVITY="9.8"
ATMOSPHERE="vacuum"
```

### Props System
```yaml
# Example: wooden-chair.yaml
id: wooden-chair
name: Wooden Chair
category: furniture
mass: 5.5
material: wood
physics_properties:
  friction: 0.7
  restitution: 0.3
  density: 600
scale_compatible: ["mm", "cm", "m"]
```

### Physics Cohesion Engine
- Props automatically adapt physics based on current session environment
- **Vacuum**: Reduced effective mass (0.1x), increased restitution (1.2x)
- **Water**: Buoyancy effects (0.6x mass), increased friction (2.0x)
- **Dense atmosphere**: Increased drag (1.3x mass, 1.5x friction)

## Technical Architecture

### Session Environment Tracking
```go
type Session struct {
    ID            string    `json:"id"`
    CreatedAt     time.Time `json:"created_at"`
    Status        string    `json:"status"`
    EnvironmentID string    `json:"environment_id,omitempty"`
}
```

### Dynamic Physics Adaptation
```go
type EnvironmentInfo struct {
    ID           string  `json:"id"`
    Name         string  `json:"name"`
    ScaleUnit    string  `json:"scale_unit"`
    Gravity      float64 `json:"gravity"`
    Atmosphere   string  `json:"atmosphere"`
    Density      float64 `json:"density"`
    Temperature  float64 `json:"temperature"`
}
```

### API Integration
- **Single Source of Truth**: All endpoints auto-generated from `api.yaml`
- **31 Total Endpoints**: Including 2 props + 2 environment endpoints
- **Build System**: `make restart` maintains specification-driven development

## Benefits

### 1. Game Engine Parity
- Matches Unity prefab/Unreal blueprint patterns
- Hierarchical object management
- Physics-aware component system

### 2. Realistic Physics
- Environment-specific gravity and atmosphere effects
- Material-accurate prop properties (wood: 600 kg/m³, metal: 7800 kg/m³)
- Scale-aware physics (molecular to astronomical scales)

### 3. Developer Experience
- API-first development with auto-generated clients
- Reusable props across multiple scenes
- Hot-swappable environments per session

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- Lazy loading of props and environments
- Session-specific environment tracking
- WebSocket real-time updates for all layer changes

## Testing Results

### Integration Validation
```bash
# Environment Discovery: ✅ 4 environments
./build/bin/hd1-client list-environments

# Props Discovery: ✅ 5 props  
./build/bin/hd1-client list-props

# Three-Layer Integration: ✅ PASS
./build/bin/hd1-client apply-environment molecular-scale
./build/bin/hd1-client instantiate-prop session-id wooden-chair
# Result: Physics automatically adapted for vacuum conditions
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Time**: <5 seconds (specification-driven)
- **API Response**: <50ms for all endpoints
- **Physics Calculation**: Real-time environment adaptation
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient prop reuse across sessions

## Future Phases

### Phase 3: Scene Orchestration System
- Scene scripts that combine environments + props
- Scene forking and inheritance
- Advanced physics relationships between props

### Phase 4: WebXR Integration
- A-Frame component mapping for all three layers
- VR/AR environment immersion
- Haptic feedback for physics interactions

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Flat Object System
- **Rejected**: No physics cohesion, poor scalability
- **Issue**: Every object would need manual physics configuration

### 2. Monolithic Scene Files
- **Rejected**: No reusability, difficult version control
- **Issue**: Props couldn't be shared across scenes

### 3. Database-Driven Props
- **Rejected**: Added complexity, deployment dependencies
- **Issue**: YAML files provide better version control and transparency
