- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-100ms latency for real-time operations
- **Security Standards**: Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive auditing
- **Scalability**: Support for 100,000+ concurrent users
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go microservices with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL primary, Redis cache, Neo4j for spatial relationships
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event-driven architecture
- **Real-time**: WebSocket gateway + WebRTC P2P mesh
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with custom vision models
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger distributed tracing
