# HD1 System Architecture Overview

**HD1 v5.0.1 - API-First Game Engine Platform**

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

HD1 follows an **API-first architecture** where all game engine functionality is exposed through REST endpoints with real-time WebSocket synchronization.

### **System Flow**
```
HTTP APIs → Game Commands → Server State → WebSocket Events → PlayCanvas Rendering
```

## 🔧 **Core Components**

### **API Router (Auto-Generated)**
- **Source**: Auto-generated from `src/api.yaml` OpenAPI specification
- **Endpoints**: 82 REST endpoints covering complete game engine functionality
- **Methods**: GET (31), POST (34), PUT (12), DELETE (5)
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time game engine operations

### **WebSocket Hub**
- **Purpose**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Performance**: <10ms message latency
- **Capacity**: 100+ clients per channel, 500+ total connections

### **Entity-Component System (ECS)**
- **Architecture**: Modern game engine ECS pattern
- **Components**: Transform, Model, Material, Physics, Audio, Animation
- **Dynamic**: Runtime component attachment/detachment

### **Channel Manager**
- **Configuration**: YAML-based scene definitions
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user environments with real-time sync

## 📊 **Performance Characteristics**
- **API Response Time**: Optimized for entity operations
- **WebSocket Latency**: <10ms for state synchronization
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for typical sessions (10-50 entities)
- **Concurrent Capacity**: 100+ clients per channel
