# ADR-013: Pure WebGL REST Platform Vision

**Date**: 2025-07-19  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: HD1 Architecture Team  
**Technical Story**: Transform HD1 into the definitive universal 3D interface platform

## Context

HD1's ultimate vision is to become the **"GraphQL for 3D Graphics"** - where any service, application, or system can render rich 3D interfaces through pure HTTP APIs, with no 3D graphics knowledge required.

### Market Opportunity
- **Current State**: 3D graphics require specialized knowledge (Three.js, WebGL, shaders)
- **Barrier**: Most developers cannot add 3D interfaces to their applications
- **Solution**: Pure REST APIs that abstract all 3D complexity
- **Vision**: 3D interfaces become as easy as HTTP calls

### Technical Vision
```bash
# Any service can create 3D interfaces
curl -X POST /api/scenes -d '{"background": "#87CEEB"}'
curl -X POST /api/geometries/box -d '{"width": 2, "height": 1, "depth": 1}'
curl -X PUT /api/materials/phong -d '{"color": "#ff0000", "shininess": 100}'
curl -X POST /api/lights/directional -d '{"intensity": 1, "position": [10, 10, 10]}'
```

### Platform Characteristics
- **Language Agnostic**: Any programming language can create 3D UIs
- **Microservice Friendly**: Services add 3D visualization via HTTP
- **Real-time Collaborative**: WebSocket sync for multiplayer experiences
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade performance and reliability
- **Zero 3D Knowledge**: Developers work with familiar REST concepts

## Decision

**Implement HD1 as the pure WebGL REST platform** with comprehensive Three.js API coverage and real-time synchronization.

### Platform Architecture
```
CLIENT APPLICATIONS (any language)
    ↕ HTTP REST APIs (200+ endpoints)
HD1 PLATFORM (Go + Three.js)
    ↕ WebSocket Real-time Sync
THREE.JS RENDERING ENGINE
    ↕ WebGL Direct Rendering
BROWSER/NATIVE CLIENTS
```

### Core Capabilities
1. **Complete Three.js API Coverage**: Every WebGL feature as REST endpoint
2. **Real-time Synchronization**: WebSocket for collaborative experiences
3. **Language Agnostic**: HTTP APIs work from any platform
4. **Stateless Design**: Cloud-native horizontal scaling
5. **Production Performance**: 60fps real-time 3D rendering
6. **Zero Dependencies**: Single binary deployment

### Use Cases Enabled
- **E-commerce**: 3D product visualization via REST APIs
- **Data Visualization**: Scientific/business data in 3D space
- **Gaming**: Multiplayer 3D environments via HTTP
- **Education**: Interactive 3D learning experiences
