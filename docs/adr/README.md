# HD1 Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the architectural decision records for HD1 (Holodeck One), documenting the experimental development of a WebGL REST platform.

⚠️ **DOCUMENTATION WARNING**: Many ADRs contain aspirational content from earlier development phases that doesn't match the current experimental reality.

## Purpose

ADRs document architectural decisions for this experimental project:
- **Decision History**: Timeline of experimental development choices
- **Context Preservation**: Understanding why technical approaches were tried
- **Development Notes**: Recording what worked vs what didn't
- **Experimental Evolution**: Tracking changes in research direction

## Experimental Principles

HD1's experimental development follows these patterns:

### 1. HTTP-to-3D Exploration
- **REST API Concept**: Testing if HTTP calls can create 3D objects
- **Three.js Integration**: Direct Scene/Mesh/Material operations
- **WebSocket Sync**: Basic real-time updates for simple operations

### 2. Minimal Implementation
- **Essential Features Only**: Basic 3D operations without complexity
- **Single API Source**: OpenAPI specification drives development
- **Auto-Generation**: Code generated from specifications

### 3. Experimental Quality
- **Research Code**: Prototype quality, expect bugs and limitations
- **XVC Development**: Built using eXtreme Vibe Coding methodology for human-LLM collaboration
- **No Production Goals**: Exploration, not finished product

## Decision Categories

### Foundation Decisions (ADR 001-003)
Established basic Three.js REST API concepts and development approach.

### Infrastructure Decisions (ADR 004-005)  
Defined WebSocket synchronization and minimal build system.

### Aspirational Decisions (ADR 006, 013)
**Warning**: Contain unrealistic visions that don't match experimental reality.

### Experimental Decisions (ADR 007-012)
Actual technical decisions for current experimental implementation.

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow the standard format:
- **Status**: Current state (Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- **Date**: Decision date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Context**: Problem space and constraints
- **Decision**: Chosen solution and rationale
- **Consequences**: Benefits and trade-offs
- **Implementation Timeline**: Key milestone dates

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New ADRs
1. Use sequential numbering (010, 011, etc.)
2. Include accurate decision date
3. Reference related ADRs and commits
4. Document implementation timeline
5. Update this README timeline table

### Updating Existing ADRs
- Mark deprecated ADRs with status update
- Create new ADR for significant changes
- Maintain historical accuracy
- Document superseding relationships

## Reality Check

Many ADRs need updating to match experimental reality:
- **Aspirational Content**: Remove unrealistic enterprise features
- **Version Alignment**: Update v0.7.x references to v1.0.0
- **Feature Accuracy**: Document what actually works vs planned
- **Honest Assessment**: Acknowledge experimental limitations
