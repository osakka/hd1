# HD1 Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the architectural decision records for HD1 (Holodeck One), documenting the architectural evolution from a minimal Three.js platform to a universal 3D interface platform.

## Purpose

ADRs serve as the **single source of truth** for architectural decisions, ensuring:
- **Decision Traceability**: Complete timeline of architectural evolution
- **Context Preservation**: Understanding why decisions were made
- **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding of architectural direction
- **Change Management**: Controlled evolution of system architecture

## Architectural Principles

HD1's ADRs collectively establish these core principles:

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- **API Specification**: OpenAPI drives all development
- **ID System**: Unified `hd1_id` across entire stack
- **Avatar Management**: WebSocket connection = avatar lifecycle

### 2. Specification-Driven Development  
- **Code Generation**: Auto-generated from specifications
- **Template Consistency**: Templates maintain architectural decisions
- **Clean Builds**: Zero warnings, zero regressions

### 3. Real-Time Architecture
- **WebSocket Protocol**: TCP-simple reliable synchronization
- **Three.js Integration**: Direct Scene/Mesh/Material operations
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls with desktop compatibility

### 4. Minimal Complexity
- **Ultra-Minimal Build**: Essential components only
- **Zero Dependencies**: Self-contained Three.js implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns maintained

## Decision Categories

### Foundation Decisions (ADR 001-003)
Established core architectural patterns and development methodology.

### Infrastructure Decisions (ADR 004-005)  
Defined real-time communication and build system architecture.

### Strategic Decisions (ADR 006)
Set platform direction toward universal 3D interface vision.

### Refinement Decisions (ADR 007-009)
Achieved architectural purity through systematic consistency improvements.

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow the standard format:
- **Status**: Current state (Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- **Date**: Decision date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Context**: Problem space and constraints
- **Decision**: Chosen solution and rationale
- **Consequences**: Benefits and trade-offs
- **Implementation Timeline**: Key milestone dates

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New ADRs
1. Use sequential numbering (010, 011, etc.)
2. Include accurate decision date
3. Reference related ADRs and commits
4. Document implementation timeline
5. Update this README timeline table

### Updating Existing ADRs
- Mark deprecated ADRs with status update
- Create new ADR for significant changes
- Maintain historical accuracy
- Document superseding relationships

## Compliance Verification

ADR compliance is verified through:
- **Code Reviews**: Architectural decision alignment
- **Build Process**: Template consistency validation
- **Documentation Audits**: ADR accuracy verification
- **Timeline Validation**: Git history correlation
