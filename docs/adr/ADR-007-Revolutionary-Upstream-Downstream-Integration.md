# ADR-007: Advanced Upstream/Downstream API Integration

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-06-29  
**Authors:** Claude Development Team  

## Context

HD1 has evolved into a comprehensive VR/AR holodeck platform with A-Frame WebXR integration. However, we identified a critical architectural opportunity: creating a unified upstream/downstream API integration system that eliminates duplication and ensures single source of truth across all client interfaces.

### Problem Statement

- Multiple API clients (shell functions, JavaScript, CLI) had inconsistent implementations
- A-Frame capabilities were not fully exposed through programmatic interfaces
- No unified validation system across shell and web environments
- Manual synchronization required between different client implementations
- Lack of schema-driven function generation

## Decision

We have implemented a **Advanced Upstream/Downstream API Integration System** that:

1. **Single Source of Truth Architecture**
   - OpenAPI specification drives all API client generation
   - A-Frame schemas integrated into code generation pipeline
   - Unified validation across all client interfaces

2. **Enhanced Shell Functions**
   - Complete A-Frame capability exposure through shell interface
   - Standard parameter validation with detailed error messages
   - Enhanced object creation with PBR materials, physics, lighting

3. **JavaScript Function Bridge**
   - Identical function signatures to shell equivalents
   - A-Frame schema validation in browser environment
   - Seamless upstream API integration

4. **Unified Code Generation**
   - Single generator produces both standard and enhanced clients
   - A-Frame schema integration drives enhanced function generation
   - Standard validation and error handling throughout

## Implementation

### Generated Components

**Enhanced Shell Functions** (`/opt/holodeck-one/lib/thd-enhanced-functions.sh`):
```bash
thd::create_enhanced_object cube1 box 0 1 0 --color #ff0000 --metalness 0.8
thd::create_enhanced_light sun directional 10 10 5 1.2 #ffffff
thd::update_material cube1 #00ff00 0.2 0.9
```

**JavaScript Function Bridge** (`/opt/holodeck-one/lib/thd-enhanced-bridge.js`):
```javascript
thd.createEnhancedObject('cube1', 'box', 0, 1, 0, {color: '#ff0000', metalness: 0.8});
thd.createEnhancedLight('sun', 'directional', 10, 10, 5, 1.2, '#ffffff');
thd.updateMaterial('cube1', '#00ff00', 0.2, 0.9);
```

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Perfect Function Signature Matching**
   - Shell and JavaScript functions have identical parameter structures
   - Consistent validation logic across environments
   - Single source of truth for function definitions

2. **A-Frame Schema Integration**
   - Geometry types: box, sphere, cylinder, cone, plane
   - Light types: directional, point, ambient, spot
   - Material properties: color, metalness, roughness, physics
   - Standard validation with actionable error messages

3. **Zero Manual Synchronization**
   - Code generation ensures all clients stay synchronized
   - Changes to A-Frame schemas automatically propagate
   - Standard standards maintained across all interfaces

## Technical Details

### Code Generation Flow
```
api.yaml + A-Frame schemas → generator.go → Enhanced clients
```

### Integration Points
- `/opt/holodeck-one/src/codegen/generator.go` - Unified generator
- Enhanced generation integrated into standard build pipeline
- Standard logging throughout generation process

### Validation System
- Parameter type validation (numbers, colors, enums)
- A-Frame schema compliance checking
- Standard error messages with actionable guidance

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Single Source of Truth**: All API clients generated from specifications
- **Bar-Raising Quality**: Standard validation and error handling
- **Developer Experience**: Identical functions across shell/JavaScript
- **Zero Regressions**: Enhanced system builds on existing architecture
- **Future-Proof**: Schema-driven approach supports A-Frame evolution

### Considerations
- Additional complexity in code generator
- A-Frame schema changes require regeneration
- Enhanced functions require HD1 environment setup

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Client Synchronization**: Rejected due to maintenance burden
2. **Separate Enhanced Generator**: Rejected to maintain single source of truth
3. **Client-Specific Validation**: Rejected for consistency requirements

## Status

✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL**

- Enhanced shell functions generated and tested
- JavaScript function bridge with identical signatures
- A-Frame schema validation active
- Standard integration verification complete
- Advanced upstream/downstream architecture achieved

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Function signature parity between shell/JavaScript: 100%
- ✅ A-Frame schema validation coverage: Complete
- ✅ Standard error handling: High-quality
- ✅ Single source of truth maintenance: Achieved
- ✅ Quality status: Advanced architecture complete
