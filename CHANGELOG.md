# HD1 Changelog

All notable changes to HD1 (Holodeck One) are documented in this file.

‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT** - This changelog reflects actual implemented changes, not aspirational goals.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-20 - Experimental Release

### Summary
Current experimental release focusing on HTTP-to-3D concept exploration. 
Basic Three.js REST API functionality working with significant limitations.

### What Actually Works
- **~40 API Endpoints**: Basic geometry, material, lighting, camera endpoints
- **WebSocket Sync**: Real-time updates for simple operations
- **Configuration System**: Environment variables, command line flags, .env files
- **Auto-Generated Client**: JavaScript client with API methods
- **Basic 3D Rendering**: Three.js r170 with simple scene management
- **Mobile Controls**: Basic touch controls for movement/camera

### Known Issues & Limitations
- **Many APIs Incomplete**: Endpoints exist but functionality is limited
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling, expect crashes and bugs  
- **Performance**: Not optimized, may be slow with complex scenes
- **Mobile UX**: Touch controls work but need significant improvement
- **Documentation**: Basic docs, many features undocumented
- **Testing**: Limited testing, expect edge cases to fail

### Recent Changes (July 2025)

#### Configuration Improvements
- **Eliminated Hardcoded Paths**: Removed hardcoded `/opt/hd1` references
- **Single Source of Truth**: Constants for all default values
- **Better Config Management**: Priority-based config system working

#### Schema Cleanup  
- **Removed Obsolete Files**: Cleaned up old schema files
- **Simplified Generation**: Streamlined code generation process

#### API Development
- **Basic Geometries**: Box, sphere, cylinder creation via HTTP
- **Material System**: Basic, phong materials partially working
- **Lighting**: Directional, point lights basic implementation
- **Scene Management**: Background color, basic camera control

### Previous Development (2025)

#### v0.7.x Series - Avatar & Mobile Development
- **Avatar System**: Basic avatar tracking and cleanup
- **Mobile Touch**: Left/right screen split for movement/camera
- **WebSocket Sync**: Real-time updates between clients
- **Session Management**: Basic multi-user session handling

#### v0.6.x Series - Three.js Integration  
- **Three.js Migration**: Moved from A-Frame to Three.js r170
- **API-First Design**: REST endpoints for 3D operations
- **Code Generation**: Auto-generated routes and clients
- **Minimal Console**: Basic web interface for testing

### Technical Architecture

#### Current Stack
- **Backend**: Go HTTP server with Gorilla Mux
- **Frontend**: Three.js r170 with vanilla JavaScript
- **Real-Time**: WebSocket for scene synchronization
- **Config**: Environment variables + command line flags
- **Generation**: OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification-driven development

### Development Status

#### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Basic HTTP server with auto-generated routes
- ‚úÖ Simple 3D object creation via REST API
- ‚úÖ WebSocket real-time sync for basic operations
- ‚úÖ Mobile touch controls (basic functionality)
- ‚úÖ Configuration management system
- ‚úÖ JavaScript client auto-generation

#### What's Broken/Missing
- ‚ùå Many API endpoints incomplete or non-functional
- ‚ùå Error handling is basic, expect crashes
- ‚ùå No comprehensive testing or validation
- ‚ùå Performance not optimized
- ‚ùå Documentation incomplete
- ‚ùå Mobile UX needs significant work
- ‚ùå No production deployment considerations

### Getting Started (Current State)

```bash
# 1. Build and start (may take a few tries)
cd src && make && make start

# 2. Try basic API (sometimes works)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/geometries/box \
  -d '{"width": 2, "height": 2, "depth": 2, "color": "#00ff00"}'

# 3. View at http://localhost:8080 (if it loads)
```

### Important Notes
- **Experimental Quality**: This is research/prototype code
- **Frequent Changes**: APIs and functionality change often  
- **No Guarantees**: Features may not work as expected
- **Use Caution**: Not suitable for production use
- **Feedback Welcome**: This is an exploration, not a product

### Development Context
- **[XVC (eXtreme Vibe Coding)](https://github.com/osakka/xvc/tree/main)**: This project was developed using XVC methodology for systematic human-LLM collaboration
- **XVC Methodology**: HD1 was developed using XVC (eXtreme Vibe Coding) - a methodology for effective human-LLM collaboration
