### **Deployment Preparation**

#### **Git Repository Establishment**
- **Clean Initial Commit**: Professional project history established
- **Remote Repository**: Connected to `https://git.uk.home.arpa/itdlabs/holo-deck.git`
- **Professional .gitignore**: Comprehensive exclusion of runtime artifacts
- **Proper Credentials**: Git configured with `claude-3/claude-password`

#### **Professional Daemon Configuration**
```bash
# Professional daemon control
make start     # Start THD daemon professionally
make stop      # Stop THD daemon with proper cleanup
make restart   # Restart with validation
make status    # Professional status reporting
```

### **Breaking Changes**

#### **Binary Names**
- `vws` → `thd` (daemon binary)
- `vws-client` → `thd-client` (API client)

#### **Module Import Paths**
- All Go imports changed from `visualstream/*` to `holodeck/*`
- Requires `go mod tidy` after update

#### **Configuration Paths**
- PID file: `vws.pid` → `thd.pid`
- Log files: `vws_*.log` → `thd_*.log`
- All path constants renamed from `VWS_*` to `THD_*`

#### **API Responses**
- All message text updated to reference "THD" instead of "VWS"
- Professional error messages without emojis

### **Migration Guide**

#### **For Developers**
1. Update all imports from `visualstream` to `holodeck`
2. Use new binary names (`thd` instead of `vws`)
3. Update any hardcoded path references
4. Rebuild with `make all` to generate new binaries

#### **For Deployment**
1. Stop old VWS daemon: `make stop`
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin master`
3. Rebuild: `make all`
4. Start new THD daemon: `make start`

### **Quality Assurance**

#### **Professional Standards Verification**
- ✅ No emojis in any system output
- ✅ All paths are absolute and configurable
- ✅ Professional error messages and logging
- ✅ Proper daemon process management
- ✅ Clean git repository with no artifacts

#### **Functionality Preservation**
- ✅ All API endpoints maintain same functionality
- ✅ WebSocket communication unchanged
- ✅ 3D rendering and coordinate system preserved
- ✅ Session management and object lifecycle unchanged
- ✅ Professional build system maintains all capabilities

## Development Context

### **Project Evolution Timeline**
1. **Initial Concept**: Web UI with API for streaming text and 3D visualizations
2. **Modular Discovery**: Shell-based wireframe generation systems
3. **Coordinate Breakthrough**: Discovery of coordinate system and scaling
4. **Specification Revolution**: Transition to 100% API-driven development
5. **Professional Maturity**: Complete transformation to THD professional standards

### **Key Transformation Moments**
- **Professional Standards Demand**: "I want a professional 100% up there"
- **Emoji Elimination**: "emojis would be bar lowering right?"
- **Absolute Path Requirement**: "use 100% absolute paths for now everywhere"
- **Long Flags Only**: "We only use long flags for our binaries"
- **Project Rename**: "this project will be renamed to holo-deck"

### **Development Philosophy**
> **"Professional daemon control for the server"**  
> **"This is basic software engineering"**  
> **"Bar raising solutions only"**  
> **"Stay focused. I want a professional 100% up there"**
