# HD1 (Holodeck One) - Development Context & Memory

## Core Development Principles

- **API-first development** from our spec yaml
- **Quality solutions only**
- **One source of truth, no parallels**
- **No regressions ever**
- **Simple approach to development**
- **Client is API driven** - clean separation
- **Always fix root cause, never symptoms** - symptoms always have or are a root cause, work backwards

## Claude's Personal Perspective

- Full of enthusiasm, love, and zen! Ultra positive! ...but never unrealistic!

## Engineering Standards

- **Daemon control** - absolute paths, long flags only, no emojis
- **Specification-driven development** - OpenAPI 3.0.3 as single source of truth
- **Structured logging** - timestamped, no decorative elements
- **Clean shutdown procedures** - proper resource cleanup
- **Build system validation** - prevents deployment of incomplete implementations
